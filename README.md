This is a benchmarks compare both Dask and Modin to Pandas.
It's based on and inspired by https://github.com/StrikingLoo/dask-dataframe-benchmarking although we fixed few issues with the Dask implementation, enhanced the code, and added the Modin comparison

This comparison is based on:
Pandas: v0.24.2
Dask: v2.2
Modin: v0.5.4
